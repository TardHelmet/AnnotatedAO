                <p class="text-block">It functions everywhere, sometimes without stopping, sometimes discontinuously. It breathes, it heats, it eats. It shits, it fucks. What a mistake to have ever said the it. Everywhere, it is machines, not at all metaphorically: machines of machines, with their couplings, their connections. An organ-machine is connected with a source-machine: One emits a flux, which the other cuts. The breast is a machine that produces milk, and the mouth, a machine coupled to that one. The mouth of the anorexic hesitates between an eating machine, an anal machine, a talking machine, a breathing machine (asthma attack). This is why we are all tinkerers; each with their own little machines. An organ machine for an energy machine, there are always flux and cuts. Judge Schreber has divine rays in his ass. Solar anus. And rest assured it works: Judge Schreber feels something, produces something, and theorize about it. Something is being produced: effects of machines, not metaphors.</p>
                <p class="text-block">The stroll of the schizophrenic: it's a better model than the neurotic lying on the couch. A bit of fresh air, a relationship with the outside. For example the walk of Lenz, as reconstructed by Buchner. It is different from moments when Lenz finds himself with his good pastor, who forces him to situate himself socially, in relation to the God of religion, in relation to his father, to his mother. On the contrary, he is in the mountains, under the snow, with other gods or without god at all, without family, without father or mother, with nature. "What does my father want? Can he give me better? Impossible! Leave me alone." Everything is a machine. Celestial machines, the stars or rainbows, alpine machines, which couple with those of his body. Noise Machine Uninterrupted. "He thought that it must be a feeling of endless bliss to be in contact with the profound life of every form, to have a soul for the rocks, metals, water, and plants, to welcome into oneself, as in a dream, every element of nature, like flowers that breathe with the waxing and waning of the moon." To be a chlorophylling-machine or a photosynthesis-machine, or at least slip his body as a part into such machines. Lenz put himself before the distinction 'man/nature', before all the identifications that this distinction conditions. He does not experience nature as nature, but as a process of production. There is no more man nor nature, only process that produces the one within the other and couples the machines together. Producing-machines – desiring-machines everywhere, schizophrenic machines, all generic life: me and not-me, exterior and interior don't mean anything anymore</p>
                <p class="text-block">Continuing from the stroll of the schizo, when Samuel Beckett's characters decide to go out. We first observe how their varied gaits are themselves a meticulous machine . And then the bicycle: what relationship does the bicycle-as-machine have with the mother-anus machine? "What rest to speak of bicycles and horns. Unfortunately it is not of them I have to speak, but of her who brought me into the world, through the hole in her ass if my memory is correct." We often believe that Oedipus is easy, that it's a given. But that is not so at all: Oedipus presupposes a fantastic repression of desiring-machines. And why, for what purpose? Is it necessary or desirable to do so? And with what? What to put in the Oedipal triangle, with what to form it? A bicycle and my mother's ass, does that do the trick? Aren't there more important questions than these? Given an effect, what machine can produce it? Given a machine, what can it be used for? Can we possibly guess, for instance, what a knife rest is used for if all we are given is a geometrical description of it? Or yet another example: on being presented with a complete machine made up of six stones in the right-hand pocket of my coat (the pocket that serves as the source of the stones), five stones in the right-hand pocket of my trousers, and five in the left-hand pocket (transmission pockets), the last pocket of the coat receiving the stones, used, as the others advance – what is the effect of this circuit of distribution where the mouth inserts itself as a stone-sucking machine? Where in this entire circuit do we find the production of pleasure? At the end of Malone Dies, Lady Pedal takes the schizophrenics out for a stroll, a carriage ride, a boat ride, and a picnic in nature : an infernal machine is preparing.</p>
